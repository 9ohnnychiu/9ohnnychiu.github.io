# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a static wedding website built with Hugo (v0.147.9) using the Hugo Story theme. The site is a single-page application with image galleries, story sections, and wedding information.

## Architecture

- **Static Site Generator**: Hugo-based static site
- **Theme**: Hugo Story theme (Creative Commons licensed)
- **Structure**: Single HTML file (`index.html`) with supporting assets
- **Styling**: CSS files in `css/` directory (main.css, noscript.css, fontawesome)
- **JavaScript**: Minified bundle in `js/bundle.min.js`
- **Images**: Gallery images in `images/gallery/` with full-size and thumbnail versions
- **Icons**: Font Awesome icons and various favicon formats

## Key Files

- `index.html` - Main page content (generated by Hugo)
- `index.xml` - RSS feed
- `sitemap.xml` - Site map for SEO
- `css/main.css` - Primary stylesheet
- `js/bundle.min.js` - JavaScript functionality
- `images/gallery/` - Wedding photo gallery (12 images with fulls/ and thumbs/)

## Development Notes

This appears to be a **deployed/built** Hugo site rather than the Hugo source code. The repository contains the generated output files, not the Hugo source files (no config.toml, content/, layouts/, etc.).

To work with this site:
- Edit `index.html` directly for content changes
- Modify CSS files in `css/` directory for styling
- Replace images in `images/` and `images/gallery/` directories
- Update favicons and web manifest files as needed

## Content Structure

The site follows a single-page story format with:
- Hero banner section
- Multiple story/content sections
- Image gallery with lightbox functionality
- Contact/wedding information sections

## Image Management

Gallery images are organized in:
- `images/gallery/fulls/` - Full-size images (01.jpg - 12.jpg)
- `images/gallery/thumbs/` - Thumbnail versions
- Main banner image: `images/YR8-7069.jpg`
